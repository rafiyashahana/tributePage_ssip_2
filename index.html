        It's not just about speed, it's about an unwavering belief in oneself
        and the audacity to take risks that define the true essence of racing.

      <p>He’s Max by name, and max by nature.</p>
      <p>
        Arriving as Formula 1’s youngest ever competitor at just 17 years old,
        Verstappen pushed his car, his rivals and the sport’s record books to
        the limit. The baby-faced Dutchman with the heart of a lion took the
        Toro Rosso – and then the Red Bull – by the horns with his instinctive
        racing style.
      </p>
      <p>
        F1’s youngest points scorer soon became its youngest race winner – at
        the age of 18 years and 228 days – with an opportunistic but
        controlled drive on debut for Red Bull in Barcelona 2016. A true
        wheel-to-wheel racer, another stunning drive in Brazil from the back
        of the pack to the podium on a treacherous wet track kept the plaudits
        coming.
      </p>
      <p>
        Verstappen’s no-holds-barred attitude and hard defending have
        sometimes landed him in hot water with his peers and paymasters. But
        the mistakes that initially marred his potential have given way to
        maturity, while the bravado and energy that make him a blockbuster
        talent have remained – and the victories have kept on coming.
      </p>
      <p>
        They led to his first F1 drivers’ crown after that now legendary,
        final-round showdown with Lewis Hamilton in 2021. He followed that up
        with a powerhouse title defence in 2022, before an epic third
        successive championship triumph, featuring a record 19 wins from 23
        Grands Prix.
      </p>
      <p>
        The son of former F1 driver Jos Verstappen and super-quick karting Mum
        Sophie Kumpen, racing runs through his genes. Despite moving out of
        Dad’s house to live in Monaco, Verstappen remains close to his family,
        and though he’s not afraid to speak his mind, he can still be
        surprisingly shy.
      </p>
      <p>
        Having become the Netherlands' first world champion aged just 24, the
        expectations for the next generation’s leading light are sky high –
        but with Verstappen there’s a feeling that the sky’s the limit.
      </p>
      <p>
        Not only did Max clinch a hat-trick of world titles, but the Dutch
        superstar also set a new record for the most wins in a season as he
        won a staggering 19 races in 2023.

        <h3>He’s rewriting the F1 record book</h3>
        <i class="ri-arrow-drop-down-line"></i>
      </div>
 
      <div class="facts-content">
        <p>Signed to Red Bull Junior Team in August 2014, Max made his F1 debut with Toro Rosso – now AlphaTauri – in
          Free Practice at the 2014 Japanese Grand Prix, aged 17 and three days, becoming the youngest driver to take
          part in an F1 race weekend. He made his race debut as the youngest driver of all time at the 2015 Australian
          Grand Prix, aged 17 and 166 days and, two weeks later, became the youngest driver ever to score world
          championship points (17 and 180 days) when he finished seventh at the Malaysian Grand Prix.</p>
        <p>One year on, he scored his first victory in F1 on his debut for Red Bull Racing at the 2016 Spanish Grand
          Prix, standing on the top step aged 18 and 228 days – that made him the youngest race winner in F1 and
          simultaneously the youngest driver to stand on the podium. On the way, he became the youngest driver to lead
          an F1 race. At the 2016 Brazilian Grand Prix, he became the youngest driver to set a fastest lap (19 and 44
          days). Fast forward to 2021 and the Austrian Grand Prix where Max became the youngest driver to set a Grand
          Chelem (23 and 277 days) taking pole, fastest lap and victory while leading every lap of the race at the Red
          Bull Ring.</p>

      <div class="facts-content">
        <p>In his debut season in the F3 European Championship in 2014, Max won seven races with Van Amersfoort Racing
          and was quickly signed to a contract by Helmut Marko for the Red Bull Junior Team. Almost a decade later he's
          on another outstanding run of victories, having equalled Sebastian Vettel’s record of nine consecutive wins in
          the World Championship. He even tied the record in style, claiming a dominant win in the wet at his home race
          at Circuit Zandvoort, much to the delight of the Dutch fans in attendance.</p>

      <div class="facts-content">
        <p>… although not anymore, because it’s now Max. Max’s father is Jos 'The Boss' Verstappen, who was team-mates
          with Michael Schumacher at Benetton and raced in Formula One for eight years, scoring two podiums – although
          he’s best known for his miraculous escape from a pit fire at Hockenheim in 1994. In fact, Max’s mother Sophie
          Kumpen was also a successful racing driver who raced in the lower leagues against Jenson Button, Giancarlo
          Fisichella and even a young Christian Horner.</p>

      <div class="facts-content">
        <p>Away from the F1 cockpit and the sim at Red Bull Racing HQ in Milton Keynes, Max enjoys gaming and competing
          in esport races racing the official Formula 1 game as well as in the racing simulation iRacing. Partnering
          with the first ever iRacing World Champions, Team Redline, he won the Virtual Le Mans Series in 2019 including
          a win at the Virtual 24 Hours of Spa with Lando Norris sharing the driving duties.

          Hasselt, Belgium, and has dual Dutch and Belgian nationalities. So both the Dutch and Belgian Grands Prix are
          home races for the World Champion – and he’s won twice at Zandvoort in F1 and three times at Spa. He lives in
          Monaco and spent a lot of his childhood in the Principality, making Monaco his home-from-home Grand Prix which
          he won in 2021 and 2023.</p>
