          It's not just about speed, it's about an unwavering belief in oneself

        <p>He’s Max by name, and max by nature.</p>

          Arriving as Formula 1’s youngest ever competitor at just 17 years old,
          Verstappen pushed his car, his rivals and the sport’s record books to
          the limit. The baby-faced Dutchman with the heart of a lion took the
          Toro Rosso – and then the Red Bull – by the horns with his instinctive
          racing style.
        </p>
        <p>
          F1’s youngest points scorer soon became its youngest race winner – at
          the age of 18 years and 228 days – with an opportunistic but
          controlled drive on debut for Red Bull in Barcelona 2016. A true
          wheel-to-wheel racer, another stunning drive in Brazil from the back
          of the pack to the podium on a treacherous wet track kept the plaudits
          coming.
        </p>
        <p>
          Verstappen’s no-holds-barred attitude and hard defending have
          sometimes landed him in hot water with his peers and paymasters. But
          the mistakes that initially marred his potential have given way to
          maturity, while the bravado and energy that make him a blockbuster
          talent have remained – and the victories have kept on coming.
        </p>
        <p>
          They led to his first F1 drivers’ crown after that now legendary,
          final-round showdown with Lewis Hamilton in 2021. He followed that up
          with a powerhouse title defence in 2022, before an epic third
          successive championship triumph, featuring a record 19 wins from 23
          Grands Prix.
        </p>
        <p>
          The son of former F1 driver Jos Verstappen and super-quick karting Mum
          Sophie Kumpen, racing runs through his genes. Despite moving out of
          Dad’s house to live in Monaco, Verstappen remains close to his family,
          and though he’s not afraid to speak his mind, he can still be
          surprisingly shy.
        </p>
        <p>
          Having become the Netherlands' first world champion aged just 24, the
          expectations for the next generation’s leading light are sky high –
          but with Verstappen there’s a feeling that the sky’s the limit.
        </p>
        <p>
          Not only did Max clinch a hat-trick of world titles, but the Dutch
          superstar also set a new record for the most wins in a season as he
          won a staggering 19 races in 2023.
